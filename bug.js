This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and it's related to the way the `keyExtractor` function is implemented. If the `keyExtractor` function returns a duplicate key for different items in your data array, you will encounter this error. The error message may not be directly clear, instead you might get unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.
